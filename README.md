#  Deepfake Image Detection using CNN and Vision Transformers

This project aims to detect deepfake images using a hybrid approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Deepfakes pose a growing threat to digital authenticity, and this project contributes to building robust AI solutions for their detection.

##  Project Goals

- Detect manipulated (deepfake) images with high accuracy.
- Compare performance of CNNs and ViTs, and explore a hybrid model.
- Create a robust model pipeline for real-world deployment.
